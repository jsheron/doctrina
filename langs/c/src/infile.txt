Let us now consider how we can characterize the progress of a process. 
(You may think about this question in a very concrete manner: suppose 
that a process, considered as a time succession of actions, is stopped 
after an arbitrary action, what data do we have to fix in order that 
we can redo the process until the very same point?) If the program text 
is a pure concatenation of, say, assignment statements (for the purpose 
of this discussion regarded as the descriptions of single actions) it 
is sufficient to point in the program text to a point between two 
successive action descriptions. 

(In the absence of go to statements I can permit myself the syntactic 
ambiguity in the last three words of the previous sentence: if we parse 
them as "successive (action descriptions)" we mean successive in text space;
 if we parse as "(successive action) descriptions" we mean successive in time.) 
Let us call such a pointer to a suitable place in the text a "textual index."
